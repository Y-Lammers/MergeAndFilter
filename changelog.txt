version 2.0 - 2020-05-15

Major overhaul of the MergeAndFilter.R script.

- Can now parse between 1 and many input OBITools tables rather than the
  previously required 2 files. This will make it more flexible when working with
  multiple reference databases.
- It will now correctly identify repeats exceeding 1 digit. The code will
  correctly identify multi digit repeat as long as the sample names are
  properly formatted.
- Only the repeats that are present in the data will show up in the samplestat
  output table. Meaning that one can mix sample with low and high repeat counts
  for example: 1-4 and 20-24, without repeats 5-19 taking up space in the
  samplestat output file.
- The code is now more flexible with the input OBITools tables. The column
  positions containing the annotation information are now longer hardcoded, but
  instead it will use grep to locate them. This will make the code more usable
  for OBITools output that is sorted differently or contains additional columns.
- General cleanup of the code, with both removal of redundant code and
  shortening of more convoluted code.

The ExtractSampleCountData.py script now works correctly on python3.

Inclusion of a README describing both scripts in terms of input files, how to
run the code, output files and output formats.

Todo:

- Make it easier to ignore the blacklist filtering, rather than providing a
  file with dummy sequences.
- Include and describe other parts of the metabarcoding pipeline.
